I will not lay in pain with shame while The blood of my brothers spills over the battleground.
" Troops from My country and Alliances, this war,the World Beyound Redemption caused by our foolish governers has brought calamity to all.
But as we fight together,our bonds have become Unbreakable . 
We Climb together towards the unknow Tomorrow and death rises from the Ashes as we grasp for Fresh Air.
As our sword became Broken overtime, we will not back out as the mesmerizing scenery of world peace inspire us all.
The Meridian will always fight for the Truth and Justice,as now our Fates Collide with one another to Fight with and Against.
Our men will Face the Darkness of all time fueled by the devil,no other than the mankind itself.
